# Orbenon
This is an N-Body Orbit Simulator Program made in Python.<br>
It uses the Game engine - <a href = "https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> and GUI engine <a href = "https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/#:~:text=Pygame%20GUI%20is%20a%20module,Pygame%202%20and%20Python%203.">Pygame GUI</a><br>
It uses the Newtonian Laws of motion to find orbits of adjustable masses.<br><br>

Currently its only 2 body system with only 1 body subject to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">N-Body Motion</a>.
# Aims
1) Both bodies affected by Gravity.<br>
2) More than 2 Body system
3) Multi-Threading for efficiency (idk what im talking about here tbh)
4) <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">And This</a>
